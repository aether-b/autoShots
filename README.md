# autoShots

10 May 2016
This project is a hobby project using the raspberry pi compute module with custom board (or any arm board) to take shots of sunsets from my home. Initial plan is to connect it to a twitter account and enable image transmission.

The shots shall be automated and triggered by scheduled scripts or some other parameters like lighting and weather reports.

Hopefully, I'll have a good collection of pictures soon.
